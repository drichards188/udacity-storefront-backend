# API Requirements

The company stakeholders want to create an online storefront to showcase their great product ideas. Users need to be
able to browse an index of all products, see the specifics of a single product, and add products to an order that they
can view in a cart page. You have been tasked with building the API that will support this application, and your
coworker is building the frontend.
